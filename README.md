A Java 21 and Spring Boot REST application that creates QR codes and stores them in AWS S3. This project demonstrates the integration of  AWS S3 for storage and Google's ZXing library for QR code generation.

## How to Use

This section provides comprehensive instructions for setting up and running the QR Code Generator application.

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 JDK
- Maven
- Docker
- AWS Account with S3 access
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

### Environment Variables

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### Running the Application

#### Local Development

1. Create the `.env` file as described above
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

#### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t qrcode-generator:1.0 . 
   ```
> Remember to replace the version and image name if you want

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 qrcode-generator:1.0
   ```
